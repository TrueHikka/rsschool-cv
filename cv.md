#### About myself:

I recently received a bachelor's degree from one of the universities of St. Petersburg. But it turned out to be a mistake, because specialization was not to my liking.

At the moment I am in search of myself. At first I tried to do contextual advertising, then card design for Wildberries. But none of this could attract me. As a result, I paid attention to programming.

In this area, it attracts not so much earnings as the opportunity to work intellectually, constantly learning new things, which does not allow the brain to dry out.
